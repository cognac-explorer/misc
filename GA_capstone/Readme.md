## Google data analytics capstone
Simple project from the Coogle DA certificate from Coursera. It simulate business task and what potential solution may looks like. 

### Scenario
Marketing team at bike-share company conduct research to find out how to maximize the number of annual memberships. Along the way they would like to know how annual members differes from casual (not-members) riders.
### Business task
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
### Data sources
There are available internal data sources containing information about each ride and bike stations. Data located in the ```data``` folder (it has been made available by
Motivate International Inc.) Data stored as .csv files.
### Solution and approach
I decided to conduct analysis in the Jupyter notebook using R programming language. Also, as it is interesting to compare R solution with Julia, there are corresponding notebook too.
Jupyter is suitable for such a task. Notebooks can contain text, code and graphics in convinient for reading form.
